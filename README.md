## Description

- With the use of this messenger several people are able to send messenges to each other.
- These messenges are saved in a database and are getting read in whenever client connects to the server so that the user is able to look up the latest messenges

## How to start the program

- Somebody needs to host the server and needs to pass in his ip address and a port in the client socket object.
- Make sure that the server host and the client users are turning off their unknown network blocking programs.
- Besides that the host needs to create a jar for the users who want to join the server.
