- With the use of this messenger several people are able to send messages to each other.
- Whenever a client connects to the server the latest data is getting read in by the server and are getting send to the currently connecting client in order to make the user/client able to look up the latest messages.
- The user is able to send a message to all clients which are connected to the server by passing in a name and the content of the message.

## How to start the program

- Somebody needs to host the server and needs to pass in his ip address and a port in the client socket object.
- Besides that a database needs to be created with the attached ".sql" files.
- Make sure that the server host and the client users are turning off their unknown network blocking programs.
- Besides that the host needs to give the users the attached jar file in order to make them able to join the server.
- The user needs to double click on the "Messenger.jar" file whenever the host is hosting the server in order to be able to send messages.
- !!!Attention, you need at least Java 1.8 and windows installed on your pc in order to correctly start my program!!!
